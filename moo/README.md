We have mainly coded using the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/), meaning that changes made by *all* developers are only saved to the local file of *one* developer. As a result, the repository contributions are skewed to one developer.

## Requirements
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

## Installation 
In this example, we're using the package manager `yarn`.

### `yarn`
Install all the dependencies listed within `package.json` in the local `node_modules` folder. Running yarn with no command is the same thing as running `yarn install`.

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
