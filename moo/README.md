We have mainly coded using the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/), meaning that changes made by *all* developers are only saved to the local file of *one* developer. As a result, the repository contributions are skewed to one developer.

## Requirements
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

## Installation with `yarn start`
