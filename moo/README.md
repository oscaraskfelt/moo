# Ghibli Movie Marathon App 
The perfect Studio Ghibli marathon companion! 

A React web app that fetches all movies from the [Studio Ghibli API](https://ghibliapi.herokuapp.com/), as well as movie posters from the [OMDb API](http://www.omdbapi.com/), for the user to read more about and rate after watching. After being rated, the movie can be found in the "Watched" page. All movies not rated can be seen in the "Not watched" page, to facilitate the movie marathon experience. 

The fetched API data, along with a "rating" key, is saved to ’localStorage’ and then updated whenever the user adds, updates, or removes a rating.

We have mainly coded using the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension [Live Share](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/live-share/), meaning that changes made by *all* developers are only saved to the local file of *one* developer. As a result, the repository contributions are skewed to one developer.

## Requirements
Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.

## Installation 
In this example, we're using `yarn`; however, other package managers (e.g. `npm`)

### `yarn`
Install all the dependencies listed within `package.json` in the local `node_modules` folder. Running yarn with no command is the same thing as running `yarn install`.

### `yarn start`
Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
